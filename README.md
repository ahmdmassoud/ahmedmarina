# My wedding website. 

It was a fun excercise that I made for our wedding. 
we used the website as a count down and as a way for our guest to confirm if they will attend the wedding or not though a confirmation form. 

In this site, I used Nodejs with express. 
I also learnt how to make a bialingual website (English and Swedish) 
I hosted the website on Heroku and connected it to a domain 
at the moment the website in not online anymore but here is a screenshot of how it looked like
